Notes and Comments.

See source code in the ex12.f90 file.
For the times data see omp_times.txt file.
See graphic (comparison of the MPI and OpenMP performances) in the .eps or .png file.
We can notice that the OpenMP's version is much faster than the MPI's.
For this version, the command line arguments continue the same (work just like the MPI's version of the code).
If you use only four arguments, the code will just print the WallClock times in the screen.
If you want to change the number of threads, please modifu the value of the integer parameter nt in the source code.
