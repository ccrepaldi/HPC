Note.
The outputs of the programs have the extension '.out'.
The compilation and execution was done in the alcyone cluster.
The tree-like structure used in the problem 3 is shown in the image packed together with the other files in this '.tgz' archive.
The number of cores used to run the programs of the problems 1,2,3, and 4 are 8, 8, 12, and 12, respectively.

Prob 1.
I used the following execution command: srun --resv-ports ./prog 22 44 666 23 98 &> $1.out

Prob 4.
Using the 'prob4.out' output to analyse the fairness of the message passing implementation, I can deduce that it is very fair since it is not possible to see a well defined pattern in the output.
In this program each process sends 100 messages with the value of 10 times its own id so you can identify from where the message came in the output.
