In problem 1:
  The output from different processor numbers is shown in the file ex7p1_n.out,
where n is the processor number (1, 2 or 4).

In problem 2-4:
  This task is compiled with 8 cores (-n 8).

In problem 4:
  I was expecting a problem in the program's execution, since the task creates
 a closed loop between the processors' message passing. However, after the 
process with id=ntasks-1 sends the message to the process with id=0, the 
program's execution ends instead of continuing forever in a infinite loop. 

NOTE:
  Compilation and execution done in alcyone.
Using the submit_parallel_use_scratch file, the program ran through the 
following command: srun --resv-ports ./prog &> $1.out
See file in the folder.
