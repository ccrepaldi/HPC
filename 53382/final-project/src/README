This folder has 3 source codes:
     poisson_omp.f90 - OpenMP version of the algorithm. If the user calls the program with 1 command line argument, the program uses this argument as the number of threads. Else, it will use 4 threads. In the end of the program's execution it will print the wallclock time.
     poisson_serial.f90 - Serial version of the code. In the end of the program's execution it will print the wallclock time.
     poisson_serial_N10.f90 - Serial version of the code with N=10. It will print several version of the matrices G and F (including the final version) so the user can see the updates and debug the code.

In order to compile the program use the make command. See the Makefile for information regarding the compilation commands of each program.

By using the command "make", the program poisson_omp will be compiled.
In order to compile the other programs use the command "make program_name" where program_name is the name of the source code file without the "*.f90" extension.

The command "make clean" removes all *.mod *.o files from the folder.
