All source code files are in the src/ directory.
All output files are in the output/ directory.
The output files are the output generated by the code run through the make command (see each problem 'Makefile') in my machine.
The commands used for compilation can be seen in the Makefiles (there is one Makefile for each problem, denotaded by the extension '.ex4pn', where n is the number of the problem). All makefiles are stored in the Makefiles/ directory.

In addition, each problem has its own directory with the source code and its 'Makefile'.

In order to compile and run the program yourself, please do so using the make command in the problem's directory. The other directories exist just for organization purposes or in case that a backup is needed after altering a file.

Note that the make command produces '.output' files and erases the executable program after running it once. Also, it should print the output files in the shell through the less command. The output printed is a concatenation of all '.output' files of the problem, in order to understand the order of the elapsed times printed, please read the 'Makefile' or just read each '.output' file separately. The printed information in the end of the make command's execution exists just for conveniently see all the outputs at once instead of reading each file separately.

In order to create a unrolled do-loop with a desired depth I used a script in m4 language. The script file shall be together with this README file in the crepaldi_caike_ex04/ directory. In order to generate the fortran code with the unrolled do-loops just use 'm4 unroll-vec-fort.m4' command in the shell. This shall print in the shell the output.
